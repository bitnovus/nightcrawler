    <h2>March 15, 2013</h2>
    <body>Meeting to finalize project choice and discuss technologies.
        Settled on python as the choice language for the back end server
        because of readability, portability, good documentation, and
        relative familiarity by the team members. Also decided on Bootstrap
        and javascript to structure and power our user-facing interfaces.
        Bootstrap provides a rapid solution to well-designed assets and javascript
        offers a clean way for dynamic updating.

    <h2>March 17, 2013</h2>
    <body>Discovered multiple bus lines had been shut down following multiple
        accidents. As such, our bus resources now only include Bolt Bus, Megabus,
        Suburban, and possibly Lucky Star. Train resources are still NJ Transit,
        MTA, and Amtrak. We will likely use Skyscanner to access airline info.

    <h2>March 26, 2013</h2>
    <body>Had a meeting setting up github accounts. Set up repository. Three people
        designated to write scripts to start scraping. One person to build a server
        to deploy to. Getting ready to meet on Thursday.

    <h2>March 28, 2013</h2>
    <body>Established and deployed on AWS the Hello World Flask application. Can
        be found at http://nightcrawler-env-sugarrrypg.elasticbeanstalk.com/.
        This website is currently a demonstration of usage of Flask deployed to AWS
        and domain CNAME by namecheap.

    <h2>April 1, 2013</h2>
    <body>Attempted to fix development environment of a team member. Ended up
        installing a virtual machine. Megabus scraper kind of working. Drew up
        web site schematics. Discussed database structures. Suburban scraper
        can traverse pages, working on traversing tables.
    </body>

    <h2>April 7, 2013</h2>
    <body>Made scripts for Orbitz. Skyscanner didn't work out. Flightstats was
        considered and we made an account for it. Attempted to scrape Kayak, but
        not particularly successful.
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>April 9, 2013</h2>
    <body>Made decision to switch from Amazon to Heroku for speed. We now
        have the ability to scrape Megabus, Orbitz, and Suburban effectively.
        Homepage looks good with Bootstrap.

        Finished move to Heroku. Static files now working? Also, project is now
        hosted at http://radiant-meadow-8177.herokuapp.com/. Still able to reach
        website at projectnightcrawler.com

    <h2>April 14, 2013</h2>
    <body>We worked on getting the time functionality working for requests working.
        We first implemented in the python scripts functionality that allows for 
        input of an hour and a minute and a boolean variable for whether the provided
        time is the time that the user want to arrive by or the time that the user
        wants to depart by.  
        
        We also worked on sorting the data by price and time (shortest to longest) and
        got the flight information (already available on the backend) to display on the website. 
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>April 21, 2013</h2>
    <body>We got time preferences working on the front end (website).  We did more
        exploration of possible scraping techniques for train information. We have
        yet to include any trains in our service.  We also worked on getting the 
        auto-complete for arrival and destination location and the pop-up calendar to
        work. We also worked to improve the style of our website. 
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>April 26, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we worked on getting the loading gif and results page working and were
          sucessful in doing that.  We also worked on search algorithm for combinging
          different pieces of routes to get the fastest and cheapest overall route. 
          Finally, we sucessfully scraped both NJ transit and Amtrak trains. 
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 2, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we spent some time making sure that we had train codes properly entered
          in the database. We also are setting up on the backend a way to display links
          on our results page that a user can click to be directed to a page that allows
          them to purchase the desired ticket.  We also are working on a more sophisticated
          algorithm to find the shortest route (i.e. by combining multiple modes of 
          transportation).
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 7, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we worked on displaying multiple legs for the Amtrak train results
          (not just the original origin and the final destination). We also realized
          that we needed to use javascript to process post requests on the front-end
          to get amtrak links to work. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 8, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we worked on our power point for the demo. We also got got NJ 
          transit fully working including mulit-leg trips. We fixed a bug related
          to displaying prices. We also worked on displaying maps on our website
          so that users can see a visual depiction of their route.
