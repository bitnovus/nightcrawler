    <p>Hello there, and welcome to Project Nightcrawler! Suppose you need to find a way to get from Princeton to Boston as quickly as possible. Should you take the bus? The train? The plane? Or what if you're saving up all your money to buy something awesome, but your family insists that you come from Princeton to Baltimore to visit them? What would be the cheapest way to get there? Trains? Buses? Planes? A combination? It might seem very confusing to have to figure out a way to plan your trip. You have to visit bus websites. Then you have to visit plane websites. And then there are the train websites. You have to piece all the different legs together. Along the way, you might wonder, "Is this really the cheapest way to get here? Can I make this faster?" Luckily, Project Nightcrawler is here to the rescue. We make it easy for you to figure out how to get from Point A from Point B in the cheapest or fastest way possible. No more visiting dozens of different websites and getting confused - we'll take care of it for you. Simply enter in your origin city, your destination city and date of travel, and we'll give you a list of routes that can be sorted by price, duration, arrival, or departure time. You can even enter in a specific arrival or departure time and we'll filter your results for you. Nightcrawler. Faster, cheaper, smarter travel!
