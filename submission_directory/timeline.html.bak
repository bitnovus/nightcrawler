    <h2>March 15, 2013</h2>
    <body>Meeting to finalize project choice and discuss technologies.
        Settled on python as the choice language for the back end server
        because of readability, portability, good documentation, and
        relative familiarity by the team members. Also decided on Bootstrap
        and javascript to structure and power our user-facing interfaces.
        Bootstrap provides a rapid solution to well-designed assets and javascript
        offers a clean way for dynamic updating.

    <h2>March 17, 2013</h2>
    <body>Discovered multiple bus lines had been shut down following multiple
        accidents. As such, our bus resources now only include Bolt Bus, Megabus,
        Suburban, and possibly Lucky Star. Train resources are still NJ Transit,
        MTA, and Amtrak. We will likely use Skyscanner to access airline info.

    <h2>March 26, 2013</h2>
    <body>Had a meeting setting up github accounts. Set up repository. Three people
        designated to write scripts to start scraping. One person to build a server
        to deploy to. Getting ready to meet on Thursday.

    <h2>March 28, 2013</h2>
    <body>Established and deployed on AWS the Hello World Flask application. Can
        be found at http://nightcrawler-env-sugarrrypg.elasticbeanstalk.com/.
        This website is currently a demonstration of usage of Flask deployed to AWS
        and domain CNAME by namecheap. Below is a screenshot of the basic homepage of our site. We bought the url <i>www.projectnightcrawler.com</i> over spring break. <br>

    <h2>April 1, 2013</h2>
    <body>Attempted to fix development environment of a team member. Ended up
        installing a virtual machine. Megabus scraper kind of working. Drew up
        web site schematics. Discussed database structures. Suburban scraper
        can traverse pages, working on traversing tables.
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>April 7, 2013</h2>
    <body>Made scraping scripts for Orbitz. Skyscanner didn't work out. Flightstats was
        considered and we made an account for it. Attempted to scrape Kayak, but
        not particularly successful.
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>April 9, 2013</h2>
    <body>Made decision to switch from Amazon to Heroku for speed. We now
        have the ability to scrape Megabus, Orbitz, and Suburban effectively. In the end, we decided not to use the results from Suburban because while we could scrape easily for schedule information, there was no straightforward way to get price information since the price information was only displayed in a pdf document. 
        Homepage looks good with Bootstrap.

        Finished move to Heroku. Static files now working? Also, project is now
        hosted at http://radiant-meadow-8177.herokuapp.com/. Still able to reach
        website at projectnightcrawler.com

    <h2>April 14, 2013</h2>
    <body>We worked on getting the time functionality for requests working.
        We first implemented in the python scripts the functionality that allows for 
        input of an hour and a minute and a boolean variable for whether the provided
        time is the time that the user want to arrive by or the time that the user
        wants to depart after.  
        
        We also worked on sorting the data by price and time (shortest to longest) and
        got the flight information (already available on the backend) to display on the website. 
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>April 21, 2013</h2>
    <body>We got time preferences working on the front end (website).  We did more
        exploration of possible scraping techniques for train information. We have
        yet to include any trains in our service.  We also worked on getting the 
        auto-complete for arrival and destination location and the pop-up calendar to
        work. We improved the style of our website. The screen shots below show to autocomplete menu and pop-up calendar in action.<br>

 <h2>April 26, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we were successful in getting the loading gif and results page working.      We also worked on the algorithm for combining
          different pieces of routes to get the fastest and cheapest overall route. 
          Finally, we sucessfully scraped both NJ transit and Amtrak trains. 
    </body>
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 2, 2013</h2>
    <body>We spent some time making sure that we had train codes properly entered
          in the database. We are also setting up from the backend a way to display links
          on our results page that a user can click to be directed to the travel service provier's page that allows
          them to purchase the desired ticket.  We also are working on a more sophisticated
          algorithm to find the shortest route (i.e. by combining multiple modes of 
          transportation).
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 7, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we worked on displaying multiple legs for the Amtrak train results
          (not just the original origin and the final destination). We also realized
          that we needed to use javascript to process post requests on the front-end
          to get amtrak links to work. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
 <h2>May 8, 2013</h2>
    <body>Today, we worked on our power point for the demo. We also got got NJ 
          transit fully working including mulit-leg trips. We fixed a bug related
          to displaying prices. We also worked on displaying maps on our website
          so that users can see a visual depiction of their route. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>May 9, 2013</h2>
    <body> We worked on fixing some of the links that we realized were broken on the website (before some of our links were simply redirecting to the home page of the travel service, not exactly the desired result ...). We also created a logo, integrated it with our website, and worked on some of the aesthetic aspects of our site. We put the total elapsed time and total cost in bold lettering at the bottom of each route. Our logo is shown below.<br>
    </body>  
    <img src="fullLogo.png" alt="logo" width=300>

    <h2>May 10, 2013</h2>
    <body> We presented our project demo today.  We met earlier in the day to debug our site a little more and practice our presentation. We found a bug in the New Jersey Transit scraping code, that was introduced the night before during a late night coding session. The bug was very subtle. Once we found it and fixed it, we ran through our demo before heading down to the presentation room. Our presentation seemed to go pretty smoothly.  
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>May 12, 2013</h2>
    <body> We got the links working fully working today. Some of them had broken recently, but we thoroughly tested them this time, so they should be good now. We debugged a New Jersey transit issue, which led us to fixing an incorrect NJ transit code in our database. We fixed formatting issues (such as a space that we were missing before the word "minutes" on our results page). We also wrote code to handle  improper user input for our site. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
    <h2>May 13, 2013</h2>
    <body> We continued to work on the write-up. We also worked on a more efficient way to get flight results from Orbitz. We are now getting two sets of results, one set that is sorted by elapsed time and another that is sorted by price. This saves our algorithm some time. Since some of our bootstrap tools don't work for Internet Explorer, we wrote code to return an error message when our page is loaded using Internet Explorer, telling users to please use Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. We also made more progress with maps tonight. We now display more accurate maps and made both the map and results pop-up windows more readable for cases in which the internet window is expanded or contracted. We also fixed an error in the database related to the code for the aiport nearest to Fairhaven, MA. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
     <h2>May 14, 2013</h2>
    <body> Today, we fixed a bug related to the link returned for Amtrak travel. Before, the Amtrak link took users to a results page that was off by one month. We also continued to work on our documentation. We improved the stability of the map display. We changed the UI, putting in a menu bar that is present on both the About and Home pages. The landing page was turned into the About page and formatted more nicely. The root URL now redirects to the home page. We also made our logo into a favicon for our site. 
    </body>     
    <hr></hr>
     <h2>May 16, 2013</h2>
    <body> We are submitting today. Most of the innerHTML code was rewritten with DOM operations in order to optimize performance. We are currently seeing about a 90% reduction of loading time of our results page. Also added some UI improvements such as Bootstrap styled buttons for tickets and maps. Added some styling so the logo and title will be more centered for smaller screens. Fixed a bug with summing issues when prices are over $1,000.
